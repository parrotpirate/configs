Yeah, I've got a few ideas, especially with what I was working on earlier in the week.  If any of these don't fit in the scope of the meeting that's fine, it's just stuff I've been working on and thinking of this week that could probably benefit from the "hive mind".

* The local dev setup has been working really well.  The only major issue I've come across is that it doesn't work for [pamharrington](https://pamharringtonexclusives.com/).  Haven't had time to really dig into possible causes, though if I had to guess It's probably because it's using a multisite setup which caused a number of new and interesting issues all through dev and launch.  Not the end of the world since I just worked on it using Valet and then copied my changes over to the repo but it might be worth talking through/looking at.  Other than that the only other things I've noticed are the previously mentioned phpmyadmin issues and the sites seeming a little slow (which could just be a docker thing and not something that can be changed).  TLDR: Talk though these and any other issues/help anyone needs.
* As I've been using the docker local setup I've also been working on a script for automating parts of the setup as I come across things that seem appropriate.  Could look at that for improvements or things that other people have noticed that should be added.
* I managed to get wp cli set up and working on the dev and live servers this week.  My plan is use that and set up some scripts on the servers to automate some parts of launches and development site setups.  I have a starting point with some local scripts I wrote but we could talk about possible expansions to what I've got or any extra requirements/issues I haven't thought of.
* I also finally got around to automating framework updates and releases (after getting frustrated with forgetting/missing steps while trying to push a hotfix Monday.).  Could walk through that for both Chris's and your benefit.  It's also currently setup in Gitlab using Gitlab's CI/CD since that's what I had a framework but we could look into what would be required to convert it to Circle Ci and move it to Github as the primary repo.  I'm sure the process and implementation is kludgy as well since I hacked together stuff I cannibalized from the Q4VR plugin and filled in gaps with the limited knowledge I was able to get from quick google-fu so any improvement thoughts that anyone has would be welcome.

I've added all the relevant files mentioned above to the [q4-scripts repo as a seperate branch](https://github.com/PropertyBrands/q4-scripts/tree/sp-additions) for now.

On a sidenote, I have a pull request open for the vr plugin that adds some fields to the settings page for contact/review forms and I'm going to open one up within the next hour for the local setup repo.  Just to give you a heads up since I'm not sure I've been setting them up right to notify you or if you have a massive influx of emails and they get lost.
